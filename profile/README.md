About-

At KIET, we believe in fostering creativity, collaboration, and hands-on learning. 
The Hostel Projects Hub is a vibrant community initiative where each hostel room becomes a hub of innovation, experimentation, and skill development. 
This GitHub organization serves as the central platform to manage, track, and showcase the diverse projects undertaken by our talented students.

#Our Vision

Empowering every student with the opportunity to transform their hostel room into a hub of innovation and learning. 
Through projects, we aim to enhance practical skills, encourage teamwork, and create a culture of continuous improvement.

#Project Repositories:
We created separate repositories for each hostel room project. Each repository should include:

README: Start with a clear and concise project description. Explain the project's goals, objectives, and expected outcomes. Include any relevant background information.

Project Plan: Outline the project timeline, milestones, and tasks. Use project management tools like GitHub Projects, Issues, and Milestones to track progress.

Documentation: Encourage contributors to maintain detailed documentation. This could include design specifications, technical documentation, user guides, and any other relevant information.

Codebase: Host the project's source code in the repository. Use appropriate version control practices, like branching and pull requests, to manage code changes.

#Weekly Updates:
Consider posting regular updates on the progress of different projects.
This could include a summary of completed tasks, ongoing work, and any challenges faced. It helps keep everyone informed and motivated.
